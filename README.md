# 2D_CNN_ACCELERATOR
This project presents a hardware accelerator for CNN inference that integrates 2D convolution, quantization, ReLU activation, and pooling in a pipelined architecture. It uses fixed-point arithmetic with configurable precision and supports parallel computation via multiple MAC units (NUM_MAC) to improve throughput.
